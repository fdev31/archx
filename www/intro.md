# Memory usage

Depending on your type of computer, you might want a different desktop environment.
Follows a list showing the available memory after a graphical login on a 4GB RAM system.

Tests are done when the system is idle after the second boot. There are single samples, to get a rough picture, but with the exact same set of apps loaded (but the environment-specific ones). Bigger numbers are better (more free memory to run your apps).

This list is from the most frugal to the most memory requiring desktop environments:

## Lightest

Requires a system with a minimum of 2GB of RAM

- **awesome: 31**

## Light

- **lxde: 27**
- **mate: 27**
- lxqt: 26 (first start was WAY bigger)
- enlightenment: 26
- xfce: 25

## Standard

- **kde: 23** (with Breeze theme, Plasma uses more memory)
- deepin: 22
- gnome-flashback: 21

## Heavy

Requires a system with a minimum of 4GB of RAM

- **cinnamon: 20**
- budgie: 19
- gnome-classic: 19
