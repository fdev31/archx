# Memory usage

Depending on your type of computer, you might want a different desktop environment.
Follows a list showing the available memory after a graphical login on a 4GB RAM system.

Tests are done when the system is idle after the second boot. There are single samples, to get a rough picture, but with the exact same set of apps loaded (but the environment-specific ones). Bigger numbers are better (more free memory to run your apps).
